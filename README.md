The themes have been created following the pallete of some famous color schemes, they have been created using two colors:

- The most important color: for the background of the wallpaper.
- The contrast / focus color of the pallete: for the Arch Linux logo.

This repository was originally created to implement a small script I programmed for changing the theme of the my terminal, my window manager ([qtile](https://qtile.org)) and my wallpaper. You can check my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/pablocorbalann/dotfiles)
